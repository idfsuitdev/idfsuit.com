# IDFSUIT Productions LLC - Project Rules

## Project Patterns

### Naming Conventions
- Components use PascalCase (e.g., HeroSection.tsx)
- Utility functions use camelCase (e.g., formatDate.ts)
- CSS modules use kebab-case (e.g., hero-section.module.css)
- Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_ITEMS)

### File Organization
- Components should be organized by feature/section when possible
- Shared components go in a common directory
- Each component should have its own directory with index.tsx for easy imports
- CSS modules should be co-located with their components

### Code Style
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Destructure props in function parameters
- Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect noir/production themes

## Design Patterns

### Noir Aesthetic Guidelines
- High contrast between elements (light text on dark backgrounds)
- Use of dramatic shadows and lighting effects
- Subtle animations that enhance the noir feel
- Typography should be elegant and sophisticated

### Color Palette
- Primary background: Near-black (#0a0a0a)
- Secondary background: Dark gray (#1a1a1a)
- Primary text: Off-white (#f5f5f5)
- Secondary text: Light gray (#b0b0b0)
- Accent: Deep red (#8b0000) used sparingly
- Highlight: Gold/amber (#ffd700) for important elements

### Animation Preferences
- Subtle fade-ins for section reveals
- Smooth transitions between states
- Avoid flashy or distracting animations
- Animations should enhance the noir storytelling

## Workflow Preferences

### Development Approach
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-driven development
- Incremental implementation of features
- Regular testing on multiple device sizes

### Documentation Standards
- Update Memory Bank after significant changes
- Document complex components with JSDoc comments
- Include responsive considerations in component documentation
- Note animation behaviors in component documentation

## Project Intelligence

### Critical Implementation Paths
- Noir aesthetic implementation is highest priority
- Contact form functionality is business-critical
- Responsive design is essential for all components
- Performance optimization for image-heavy sections

### Known Challenges
- Balancing dark theme with readability
- Ensuring animations perform well on mobile
- Maintaining noir aesthetic across all screen sizes
- Optimizing image-heavy noir visuals for performance

## User Preferences

### Communication Style
- Direct and technical communication
- Focus on visual and aesthetic details
- Emphasis on noir and sophisticated elements
- Attention to typography and spacing details

### Priority Areas
- Visual impact of the noir aesthetic
- Professional presentation of production portfolio
- Smooth, intuitive user experience
- Mobile responsiveness for all features

## Tool Usage

### Next.js Patterns
- Leverage App Router for all routing
- Use Server Components where possible for performance
- Client Components only when interactivity is needed
- Metadata API for SEO optimization

### CSS Approach
- CSS Modules for component styling
- Global variables for theme consistency
- Mobile-first media queries
- Fluid typography system

### Form Handling
